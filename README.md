# AutonoMouse

## Introduction
Lightweight and low cost autonomous robotics platform for students to gain skills and have fun!

There are two version to this project. 

V1's objective is to build a small autonomous car using Arduino Nano as a controller. The car drives forward until sensing an object. When it senses an object it pivots to both sides to find both distances to the nearest object. It then chooses to travel the distance that is greater. 

V2's objective is to build a similiar autonomous car using ESP32 as a controller. However, this version
allow's the user to put the car into remote control mode where the user can control the car via bluetooth
using an Android smartphone. This doesn't work with an IPhone because there are no opensource bluetooth apps 
that in the App Store. 

## V1 Things to Change
More accessibility Linux and Apple users. Document how to download Arduino IDE and how to interfaces with Arduino devices.

## V2 Things to Change
Finish development for V2. Mostly needs work with the servos.
