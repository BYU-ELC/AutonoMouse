## Arduino Nano version of the Autonomouse

# PCB
Recommended: In Build_Files folder, mill Chassis1.0 using the build files provided. 

NOT TESTED: This is not recommended for ECEN191 as diodes are not covered in the labs. Chassis1.1 fixes the issue 
programming Arduino Nano while it is inserted into the PCB by using reverse diode protection. You will
need to understand how to solder the diode to the PCB and buy the proper diode. Use the 1N4004.

# Acrylic Base
Laser cut the acrylic base using Arduino_Nano_chassis.svg in Build_Files folder. 

# Labs
Follow the labs sequentially in Labs folder.

# Code
Code is provided along with most labs. Upload the code to Arduino Nano using a USB A-Mini and the Arduino IDE.
